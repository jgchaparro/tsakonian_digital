  Generates search suggestions based on Levenshtein distance.
  Entries with a distance less than or equal to the threshold are returned.

  Parameters:
  - input_string (str): The input string to compare against.
  - list_of_strings (list): A list of strings to compare against.
  - threshold (int): The maximum distance allowed for a string to be considered a match.
  - orthography (str): The orthography to use for the distance calculation. 
    Options are 'nowakowski' (default) and 'kostakis'.
